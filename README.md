#Predicting Customer Churn

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using a combination of machine learning algorithms: XGBoost Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, and Logistic Regression. 

The project also includes hyperparameter tuning for the XGBoost Classifier to optimize its performance.

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

Python

XGBoost

Random Forest

Logistic Regression


ðŸŒŸ Features

Model Comparison: Implementation of three different classifiers (XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression) to predict customer churn, allowing for comparison of performance.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuning the XGBoost Classifier to enhance prediction accuracy and model robustness.


ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

The goal of this project is to develop a reliable model for predicting customer churn, helping businesses retain their customers by identifying those at risk of leaving.

Beacuse of the simplicity of the dataset Logistic Regression model was the best accurate model for the predictions. Hence, We can argue that in terms of performance, XGBoost and Random Forest often outperform Logistic Regression, especially on complex datasets. However, Logistic Regression offers better interpretability, allowing easier understanding of feature importance.
